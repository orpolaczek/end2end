# I love Jekyll! 
Seriously, I used to blog 10 years ago as a teenager.
All you had to do is pick up a 'skin'/'template' and write content.

You had those funky [WYSIWYG](http://ckeditor.com/) text editors and a way-too-long URL you'd share with your friends. Where's the fun with that?


[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is (quote:) a simple, static & blog-aware engine writted in Ruby that let's you create an awesome looking (depends on the template you're using) website/blog from HTML / [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.

It Also allows you to keep adding post by simply placing a new Markdown file in a folder.
No more configuring WordPress & backing it up periodically. All your files are static and committed to a GIT repo.

### Getting started..
Basically, I followed the [Jekyll quick-start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) step by step.

I spent about two hours picking up a cool [Jekyll template](http://jekyllthemes.org/) before moving on to adjusting it to my needs.

I ended up choosing the neat looking [end2end](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/end2end) by **Fernando Moreira**. Thanks Fernando!

After making some fine-tuning to the template and writing this post, i've committed the output to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). It works fast, it has SSL, Jekyll is kind of made for this AND it's free!


After puting ~4 hours to this process (over almost two months, lazy me), I now have a functioning personal homepage / blog.
